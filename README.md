# Trekko-Test

This repository contains a Next.js App Router project. The home page lives in `app/page.tsx`.

## Viewing the Home Page

GitHub Pages only serves static files and cannot run the dynamic Next.js application. To see the home page, run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

For production deployment use a Node-compatible host such as Vercel instead of GitHub Pages.
